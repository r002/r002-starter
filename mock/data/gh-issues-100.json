    "body": "I spent the day thinking through where I want to take my coding journey next. I read through an article on free resources for learning data science, and I looked at the analytics course that Robert sent me and a few other edX courses on data analytics & science. \r\n\r\nI was having difficulty deciding whether I wanted to stick with python and data analytics/science or go back to learning Web Dev (via The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp). I've found the Google data cert a little boring, and it was kind of turning me off from continuing on with data analytics. So I had a brainstorming session to figure out what's next.\r\n\r\nAfter deliberating, I decided that I want to stick with data analytics. I think it pairs nicely with my educational background and career experience. I think that I'll be able to rekindle my love for some things that I haven't had a chance to do in a while (hello again math), and I think that it's a solid career path with great opportunities (and pay!).\r\n\r\nSo far, I've been enjoying the Kaggle 30 Days of ML challenge, and it's been showing me more of what's available and the type of problems that you can solve with Python and data and machine learning techniques.\r\n\r\nI did some digging into other resources that I can use to learn, and I think I've settled on Dataquest as being my primary learning platform (once I'm done with the Kaggle challenge), along with the free resources available on learning Python and general computer science topics. I also plan to leverage my existing Coursera Plus subscription to take courses.\r\n\r\nThe Google Data Analytics Professional certificate isn't all bad. I like the way they reiterate key points, and I enjoyed checking out BigQuery and practicing SQL queries on the huge datasets that they have. So while I find certain things tedious, I will finish the cert. I also committed to finishing it back in April, and I want to stick to delivering on my commitments. So far I've knocked out two out of three:\r\n- I finished the Python for Everybody specialization.\r\n- I finished 100 Days of Code\r\nNow, I just need to knock out this last one and then continue on to a more challenging data science course. I also need to brainstorm a good data analysis project I can tackle. I will still keep chipping away at my existing project XDaysOfY.\r\n\r\nI came up with the following preliminary goals:\r\n- Finish the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate\r\n- Finish Kaggle's 30 Days of ML and any other courses they offer.\r\n- Work through the free content on Dataquest (once I max out the free content, I plan to upgrade to a subscription).\r\n- TBD...\r\n\r\nThat's all I have for today!\r\n\r\n**Links:**\r\n[How to Learn Data Science for Free](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-learn-data-science-for-free-eda10f04d083)\r\n[Into to Analytics Modeling](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-analytics-modeling)",

Time is flying because that means I'm 33% complete with the Kaggle challenge. I feel like I just signed up. Today I learned about a new model: Random Forest. I am definitely in the deep end right now. I'm at the point where I'm using the models, but I don't fully get them yet. It's still cool though.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Observations & Next Steps 🔭👣:\r\nI will continue on with 30 Days of ML. I'm also exploring some other sites that have data science tutorials and instructions. I'm still undecided on my next move.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References 🔗:\r\nLink any useful resources you may have found throughout the day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun (Optional) 🎈🎉🥳:\r\nI spent a good hour and a half outside soaking up the sun. I also had a good chat with a tech twitter friend. I'm getting to know more and more people. Overall, it was a really good day. 😌\r\n",

    "body": "# Wednesday\r\nDiscovered [Denise Yu](https://deniseyu.io/blog/) today.  So good.  It's so surreal at times to find other people who share many of the same interests (topics, podcasts, activities, thought-lines) as yourself.  But I guess the internet is big so such is inevitable!  Still, it always breaks my brain a bit every time this happens.  Discovering her, [Ben Congdon](https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2021/02/21/Three-Layers-of-Information/), [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), [swyx](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), and [Paul Robertson](https://twitter.com/probzz) have definitely been highlights this year.  At some point, I'm going to add a `Blog Roll` feature to `StudyDash`.  (I've added it to the [`Road Map`](https://github.com/studydash/cards/issues/75)!  Poor `Road Map`.  Every time one feature gets implemented and crossed out, three new ones get added... 🙄)\r\n\r\n### Also:\r\n- https://obsidian.md\r\n- https://foambubble.github.io/foam/\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Dreams:\r\nOnce upon a time, I loved web comics like _Apple Geeks_, _Ctrl-Alt-Delete_, _MegaTokyo,_ and _Penny Arcade_.  And growing up, I worshipped _Calvin and Hobbes_.  At some point though, I put aside those aspirations thinking it was time to \"grow up\" 😔. \r\n\r\nHowever-- _`\"It's never too late to be what you may have been\"`_, goes the old saw.  If I can find it, I'm going to scrounge up the old Cintiq and get back into it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## [Westrum Organizational Culture](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/129060596-ec31465a-dd30-46b3-a908-9a855ba2d83f.png)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References:\r\n- https://deniseyu.io/tech-for-evil (So good!

    "body": "# Tuesday\r\nStill practicing lots of algo questions.  Gotta admit... it's been a while.  😑  Usually, for daily development, I'm working with APIs, moving/wrangling data, trying to make things look halfway decent in CSS.  Or I'm making a video, writing docs, or emailing people.  Or I'm just trying to learn/explore something new which entails a lot of trial-and-error.  \r\n\r\nIn summary: All very different than solving algo questions which requires _much_ more concentration and focus.  I really like it but it's definitely mentally taxing in a way that daily dev isn't.  Training these different brain muscles is fun though! 😄\r\n\r\nIt's funny-- but in coding one can definitely, unfortunately, build bad habits.  😤  For example, for me --especially when I'm tired-- I sometimes fall into a hole where I'm just tweaking the code to fix a certain bug.  But I'm no longer actually _thinking through_ what I'm actually doing.  All I see is console output-- and I'm basically just _reacting_ to that console output, to make a bug or undesired output go away.\r\n\r\n### This is very bad! 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️\r\n\r\nIt's not even really \"coding\" anymore-- when I get into this state, it's basically like being in [John Searle's Chinese Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room#Chinese_room_thought_experiment). 🤦‍♂️  At this point, it's actually always best to just take a break, get away from the screen, and then return later with fresh eyes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm gonna keep at it!  Practice, practice, practice! 😅\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Easy:\r\n - https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Remove%20Duplicates%20From%20Linked%20List\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Practice more:\r\n- `Binary search trees`\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Other/Fun 🎉🎈:\r\n- https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/\r\n- Today marks by `100th` consecutive day on `StudyDash`! 🥳\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/128963821-65d4ab89-1f3b-44fe-98d1-332cb123ef50.png)\r\n",

Could have saved myself a lot of time and hassle.  There's a `save10` discount code you can use which knocks the price down to $89/year.  I used to practice on `LeetCode` and `HackerRank` but those free platforms lack the clear organization and explanations on `algoexpert`.  It's very worth it, IMHO.  Especially, the [visualizations](https://www.algoexpert.io/swe-project-contests/2020-summer) [contests](https://www.algoexpert.io/swe-project-contests/2020-winter).

I have a paid account, but this org (`StudyDash`) is _not_ a paid account, so I'm limited to `10 MB`!  Nooooo.... 🤦‍♂️\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/128494942-a6a5183e-8e07-4ce9-9699-891873c57314.png)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I posted a comment over on a [similar project](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer-demo/issues/1) which has the video embedded there.  (That project is super-awesome, btw; by the always amazing [Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/); check it out!)   Eventually, I'll submit some feedback to GitHub though:  It'd be cool if you had a paid account that the [100 MB](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) upload privilege follows you around to _any repo_ you visit!  If the person's paying, shouldn't they be granted the privileges anywhere they go? 🤷‍♂️\r\n\r\nAlright, now it's time to finally go to sleep.... 😴 super-busy day in a few hours!! 😄",

Today, I'm going try to finish some small coding tasks on the `studydash` GUI though.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Today's tasks:\r\n- [x] Show `day labels` (eg. `Tue, 8/3`) on every row of the `card grid`\r\n- [ ] Put the `Countdown Clock` in the upper right-- make it an old-school, analog clock\r\n- [x] Put the footer at the bottom\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Reading\r\nLast night, I bought [_Analytics Interpreted: A Compilation of Perspectives_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VZXD469) and have been slowly reading through it to glean more insight into the analytics world.  Fascinating stuff! 😀\r\n\r\nOne takeaway from Pam Castricone's article that I really liked was the emphasis that even though it's easy to parachute in out of domains, because of ubiquitous open datasets, equally important --if not more important-- is `subject matter expertise`.  Anyone can swoop in and run regressions on data to find trends and correlations.  But coming up with `prescriptive analytics` is a whole different ballgame.  You _**really**_ need to understand at a deep level the space that you're working in because there will always be tons of factors _**not**_ captured in the data.  Thus, top-down `SME` is critical.  In summary:  Be prepared to \"pitch a tent and stay a while\":\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/128088226-df85e118-7bdc-4178-9b29-e6b6166c5e21.png)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Other/Fun 🎉\r\nStack Overflow shared the results of their `2021 Developer Survey`!  Some pretty neat results.

    "body": "# Wednesday\r\nStarted using Figma today!  By chance, I also discovered that the amazing [Amelia Wattenberger](https://github.com/Wattenberger) is also creating some kind of `Repo Visualizer` [project](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer).  I haven't run her project yet but it apparently generates an SVG from your repo.  (I'm guessing it does something similar to the [Skyline project](https://skyline.github.com/), but with [trees](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer/commit/30d29503dcf6e9378e59ea048f3ad6429c461b16)?)  I am working on `issues visualization` so it may be related! 😄\r\n\r\nMy project is similar to Amelia's (I think) but the number of CSS poly-art trees/huts/clouds/mountains are generated by the `cards` you create!  🥳  And over time, you'll work together with your study group (up to four people, max) to create a scene.  And the scene changes every month.  (This idea was also inspired by the different cool `Windows 10` lock screens I see every morning!)  We work hard every day to contribute our cards-- the least we can get is a nice visualization! 🎉\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Today's Progress\r\n\r\nMockup of the new GUI redesign (with today's data) in Figma:\r\n_(Note: CSS background art credit goes to [Luke Reid](https://codepen.io/lukeandrewreid).)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/127420384-c350a569-0a5a-413b-86df-bf5a50e75cbf.png)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n- [ ] Figure out where to put all of the `Streak Counter` [meta-information](https://studydash.github.io/).  Tucked away in a hover-menu?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/127423326-f94f7989-a415-4a15-933f-76a3e1a36726.png)\r\n- [ ] Figure out where to put the `Countdown Clock`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/127423345-ab2ea308-c0ea-4c8f-a506-92ace85b3342.png)\r\n- [x] Move all `html`/`css` code to [`studydash/studydash.github.io`](https://github.com/studydash/studydash.github.io)\r\n  - [x] Move existing `index.html` into `/docs`\r\n  - [ ] Set up a dev harness for the new GUI; load all mock production data from a static `.json` file\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://codepen.io/lukeandrewreid/pen/LpWgmg\r\n- https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer\r\n- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chenla?category=Display&preview.text_type=custom",

I like how GitHub tracks a complete `audit history` of a card.  Using that feature, I'll be able to track my day very granularly (at an hourly or less interval) to keep tabs on what I actually did all day.  And then at the day's end, I'll recap with my usual summary.\r\n\r\nI usually wait until EoD to summarize my day but at night I'm usually tired and my brain's exhausted so I forget a ton of details.  Let's try this new system to see how it goes!  🥳\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Today's Tasks\r\n- [ ] Work on rotating this SVG circle on its `z-axis` to simulate a spinning sphere\r\n  - https://blog.logrocket.com/the-noobs-guide-to-3d-transforms-with-css-7370aafd9edf/\r\n  \r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/127148943-769debb4-46a5-442a-808a-e7bbeb8685d9.png)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Other/Fun 🚀\r\nWe'd exhausted all of our food supplies so in the evening, Shaza & I drove over to the Loveland Farmer's Market to buy more produce.

    "body": "## Motivation/Problem Statement 💭❓:\r\nCreate a code challenge tracker app.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Today's Goal/Solution 🥅:\r\nWork on the journal lite feature: add & modify journal entries.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Result 🍓🍌🍉:\r\nI'm using a bunch of custom classes, and I was having a hard time figuring out how to make them JSON serializable. I found a couple of articles, but the solutions weren't really what I was looking for since I have nested custom objects (not just one), that need to be encoded. I finally figured out that I could create an instance method that returned either a dictionary or list when called. So far, it seems to be working.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Observations & Next Steps 🔭👣:\r\nContinue creating my new classes and associated tests. I also have a couple of existing classes to modify.\r\n\r\n*Update* I got a big portion of the journal lite feature working. It's ugly, but I can now create, modify and view journal entries from the CLI. Any updates I make are then saved in the json config file. My code is pretty mangled as I had to tear apart existing classes and create new ones to do it, but it's working. 🎉🎉🎉 \r\n\r\nTo-Do List:\r\n- [ ] Fix my test files. (I'm currently failing 10 out of 34 test cases).\r\n- [ ] Implement journal export from the app (i.e. create a text file with all of the journal entries)\r\n- [ ] Rework my existing classes to remove repetitive code. I may also need to update some methods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References 🔗:\r\nLink any useful resources you may have found throughout the day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun (Optional) 🎈🎉🥳:\r\nWatched some of the olympics.\r\n",

To begin, the code uses `BFS` (with early-exit) to find an optimal path.  So far I've just been throwing everything into this single [file](https://github.com/r002/interview_prep/blob/4e9e140018f528d3fd256c3defe60fa21d962689/web/pathfinding.html).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/127076501-e7e81cf2-3aec-4043-9338-8a40eae4a405.png)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Next\r\nI've been spending a lot time recently reviewing algorithms but the reality is that a lot of `algorithmic thinking` really only happens when you're working with lower-level graphics or manually building a videogame from scratch (ie. not using a game engine).  It's been fun but I've been neglecting the `StudyDash` GUI `beautification redesign` so I really need to get back to that.  I have a ton of ideas; just need to implement them!",

By total chance, I stumbled over this great [summary](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html) online, complete with interactive maps and samples.  It's all stuff I've learned and implemented before, but I wanted a good exercise in reviewing basic `BFS` algorithms and `graph traversals` so pathfinding is one of the more fun applications of that.  😎\r\n\r\nI also spent a ton of time on `SketchFab` perusing through different 3d models, getting some inspirations on what I'm going to work on next.  I did successfully figure out how to import my `.glb` model from `Blender` into `three.js` but the results are _**awful**_.  Haha-- still have a ton more to figure out!  😅\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/126921605-ba3f9ff7-3c76-41e0-8f63-f0f8026cfb76.png)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene\r\n  - https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_skinning_morph\r\n  - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_animation_skinning_morph.html\r\n  - https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Animation-system\r\n- https://sketchfab.com/aclab13/collections/cartoon\r\n- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/pot-gacha-b71f7380a3af450ca8808ee79f8fb077\r\n- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/food-truck-of-the-future-0a760e2f8cca4cf1969643791f65dd83\r\n- https://www.artstation.com/artwork/1AGwX\r\n- https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_animation_keyframes.html\r\n- https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#breadth-first-search\r\n- https://danthedev.com/2015/07/25/binary-in-javascript/\r\n  - https://github.com/danprince/tiny-binary-format\r\n  - https://jsbin.com/zeqevi/edit",

    "body": "# Friday\r\nI continued following CG Geek's [`\"Low Poly Island\"`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lj643VmTsg) tutorial today and learned about `vertex painting`, `modifier ➡ skin` and `modifier ➡ decimate`.  I also played around more with `sculpting dynamic topology`.  This entire world is super-fascinating!  😄  From a young age, I'd always harbored artistic aspirations but couldn't ever draw to save my life.  😞  So, sadly, at some point I shelved my dreams of making a web comic like `Penny Arcade` or `Apple Geeks` and just focused on coding.\r\n\r\nBut now, over two decades later, having found `Blender` and this `low-poly` style, hope once again springs eternal! 😁  I honestly just spent _**hours**_ today looking through `Deviant Art` and `Google Image Search`, finding cool low-poly art and getting a better sense of what's possible.  Am super-excited! 🥳\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/126856062-e4083141-f59c-4b3f-b832-ed98c452116f.png)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Other/Fun 🎈\r\nThe belated `2020 Olympics` has kicked off in Tokyo!  Holy cow, I'd totally forgotten about that!  The greatest part is YouTube is serving up tons more soccer clips! 🎉⚽  Oh man-- `Copa América`, `Euro 2021`, and now the `Olympics`!  This summer's been positively lit!  🤗",

    "body": "# Thursday\r\nIn order to spruce up StudyDash's GUI a bit, today, I embarked upon a new journey of exploring `Blender`.  Many years ago, in college, I'd learned Maya for a 3D animation class but I haven't worked with modeling at all since then.  Luckily, there are tons of free resources online nowadays!  As my first foray into Blender, I've been following this great [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lj643VmTsg) by CG Geek to make a `\"Low Poly Island\"`.  It's been a ton of fun! 🥳\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/126733859-15d9a8d0-9aec-49d5-bc70-1853e54e5e52.png)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lj643VmTsg\r\n- https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/load-models/\r\n- https://cmichel.io/importing-blender-model-with-texture-to-threejs/\r\n- https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-fundamentals.html\r\n- https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/models/gltf/Stork.glb",

    "body": "# Wednesday\r\nFor a while now, I've been mulling over better ways of representing `study member` progress.  Ever since the beginning, I always wanted to gamify the entire process of studying in a group.  The idea was something along the lines of:\r\n- Making daily `card` contributions would be how you progress through the map.  Eg. One's day's contribution would move you forward one square towards a destination.\r\n- As you gained skills and knowledge, that would become you character's `\"equipment\"`.  Eg. Listening to a new podcast would gain you the `Helmet of Knowledge` while reading a blog post would garner you the `Chainmail of Wisdom` 😄\r\n- Your study group cohort is your party.  To further incentivize people to not miss daily contributions, every day you missed would leave you one square behind on the map.  And if you missed too many days, then you'd fall off the map entirely!  (Maybe this would reset every month? 🤔)\r\n\r\nThe idea's still inchoate atm but that's the general idea.  Today, I played around with [`Tiled`](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and followed this great [guide](https://tjconti12.medium.com/?p=a627de67b7d9) to get started.  The adventure begins! 😁\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/126585513-c4cad6de-81d4-4eb4-9947-c08db6e83ada.png)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Today's Tasks\r\n- [ ] Begin building `World Map of Progress`\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://led.itch.io/tilesetter\r\n- https://stealthix.itch.io/rpg-nature-tileset\r\n- https://pixelmochii.itch.io/mochii-plains\r\n- https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-indie\r\n- https://solaarnoble.itch.io/free-iso-set\r\n- https://tjconti12.medium.com/?p=a627de67b7d9\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage\r\n- https://www.artstation.com/artwork/58190O\r\n- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/2d-isometric-fantasy-heroes-sprites-x-9-animations-84772\r\n- https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled\r\n- https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/",

    "body": "# Tuesday\r\nToday, I finally took the time to properly set up `CI/CD` for the [`services`](https://github.com/r002/storyline-api) backend code.  I've set up two environments:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/126414385-ae8884cd-e955-4ee3-bc71-ba3986b0bf55.png)\r\n\r\n### The workflow setup:\r\n- Anytime a PR is made to `main`, that'll kick off a build in the `QA` environment.  The branch being built must be named `qa` or `patch-*`.\r\n- Anytime code is pushed to `main` (eg. from a merge or direct push), that'll kick off a build in the `PROD` environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my `Google App Engine` code, the `PROD` build workflow also deploys the `GCF` (Google Cloud Function) for the `UpdateMemberMetrics(...)` function in `PROD` as well.\r\n\r\nThis was my first time setting up `environments` in `GitHub Actions` but everything went pretty smoothly!  I encountered a tiny [hiccup](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions/issues/123) setting up the `GitHub Action` for GCF but the Google person was super-responsive and helpful!  Basically, what I'd been concerned about was a total non-issue. 🤦‍♂️\r\n\r\nAnyway, all of this devops stuff is properly set up now so I can finally get back to coding! 😄\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Today's Tasks\r\n- [x] Set up [`environments`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments) for `GitHub Actions`\r\n- [x] Deploy `Services 0.0.19` to `PROD` (this is the version that adds `LastCard` to the `StudyMember` model)\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/126415588-42591d74-b76b-4b84-8170-e25bf5630a91.png)\r\n  \r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/126415684-429f212f-729b-42e0-ab9c-5b240634afef.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References 🔗\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59422730/user-does-not-have-storage-objects-list-access-to-bucket/59426918#59426918\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66521958/how-to-access-environment-secrets-from-a-github-workflow/66526312#66526312\r\n- https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions\r\n- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments#deployment-branches\r\n- https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/issues/245\r\n- https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions/issues/58#issue-878647026\r\n- https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions/issues/123",

    "body": "## Motivation/Problem Statement 💭❓:\r\nCreate a code challenge tracker app.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Today's Goal/Solution 🥅:\r\nWork on importing and exporting json data so that program can \"remember\" a user's progress.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Result 🍓🍌🍉:\r\nYo!!! I have been elbow-deep in code ALL DAY. I've implemented, deleted, reimplemented, been lost as to why I was failing my own test cases, fixed bugs, had epiphanies, and 500 other things.\r\n\r\nI've done so many things, it's hard to even list it all here, but I'll try. I implemented the following:\r\n\r\n- modified main.py to have a program flow. Before it just displayed the challenge details and then ended. Now it checks if there's a valid config file. If so, it loads your progress in and then prompts you for what you want to do next. If there's no config file (or it's invalid), it asks you for your start_date and duration and then loads a new challenge.\r\n- implemented config file imports. I can now read in a json file, validate that its good data and if so, load it into an instance of the ChallengeTracker class. This gives the program memory\r\n- to test out the config import, I created some fake json files: an empty one, one with invalid json, one with valid json but invalid program data, and a valid one. I still want to go back and see if I need some others to get good coverage. Wearing my testing hat has been interesting.\r\n- used the VSCode debugger. In the past, I was a print to console debugger. With this program, there are so many variables and methods and interactions between them that print statements aren't effective; I'd end up needing a bajillion of them all over the program. I actually conquered my fears and used the VSCode debugger to set breakpoints, step into methods, watch certain variables and detect issues. What a difference it made!!! Honestly, between using some principles from TDD and the debugger, I saved myself sooooooo many headaches. Like I feel like a real python developer. 😭😭😭\r\n\r\nAnd now, the moment we've all been waiting for, a screenshot of program execution.\r\n<img width=\"646\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 1 32 31 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9167395/126439192-9bfafb48-f473-4d3d-8b02-8e7fbf476884.png\">\r\n\r\nIs that gorgeous or what??????? 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Observations & Next Steps 🔭👣:\r\nI need to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement config file exporting when program data is added or modified.\r\n- [ ] Remove the PunchCard class (decided to go a different way and no longer need it)\r\n\r\nAt some point, I also need to go back through my test files and make sure I have good coverage. I don't expect they're perfect, but they help a lot in catching errors as I modify the code. I don't know where I'd be without my unit tests. Crying in a corner.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References 🔗:\r\nYou can see my project files in this [repo](https://github.com/anitabe404/100DaysTracker). The organization is a bit of a mess, but one step at a time!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun (Optional) 🎈🎉🥳:\r\nI actually made it into the backyard with the kiddo. I'm all flames today.\r\n",

When given a start date and duration, the program can show you:\r\n- your end date\r\n- the current day that you're on.\r\nI was also able to implement the code for days remaining. I started on the code for counting missed days, but I realized this requires the program to remember the data (it wouldn't be much of a tracker if it forgot your missed days every time you restarted the program, haha).  This means that I need to save user data in a config file after they enter it or modify it. I decided to go with a json format for the config file.\r\n\r\nSo I need to update the code to create json files and import json files. On import, I have to do some data validation to make sure I don't have garbage. \r\n\r\nI've been taking a TDD approach, and it's helped me a lot. Caught some bugs in code right away by having test cases. (Rather than staring at the console hopelessly confused)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Observations & Next Steps 🔭👣:\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References 🔗:\r\nLink any useful resources you may have found throughout the day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun (Optional) 🎈🎉🥳:\r\nN/A\r\n",

This whole project has been very organic; tomorrow I'll spend some time refactoring and reducing technical debt.  Some things to clean up:\r\n- Study Members are hardcoded!  This means every time I onboard a new member, I need to push code.  🤦‍♂️  For a while now, I've already been storing all study members in a `Firestore` collection (first used when I built the `MembersPane` widget and coded the `UpdateNightlyMetrics` cloud-scheduler job.  Tomorrow, I'll refactor the GUI to actually source all study members from `Firestore`. \r\n- Properly set up `GitHub Actions` for all `services` across different [environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments).\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments",

I'm super close to finishing Week 4 of 6 in the Processing Data from Dirty to Clean course. My goal was to finish Week 3, so I'm well beyond that! So I can report that in my upcoming biweekly recap.\r\n\r\nI also spent some time brainstorming the progress tracker that I want to make for 100DaysOfCode. It'll be a computer app that uses Tkinter for the GUI. I chose Tkinter because it seemed interesting and different. I suppose a web app would be more accessible, but meh, I want to try something different.\r\n\r\nI wrote some preliminary \"user stories\" - I hesitate to call them stories because they are so rough, and I don't know that they follow good story conventions - that I need to organize into an MVP vs add-on features. I also started making some rough UML Object diagrams to keep track of the attributes and functions that I'll need. I have a preliminary idea for how to organize the code, but I'm still sorting through that. Lastly, I came up with a task list (things that I need to do in order to finish the project); I'm still working on it, but it's a start.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Observations & Next Steps 🔭👣:\r\nI will continue working through Google DA course 4.\r\n\r\nFor my project, I need to continue working on the task list, and then start to organize it into some type of schedule. I also need to organize the stories into features and pick out what's a must-have vs. a nice-to-have.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References 🔗:\r\nLink any useful resources you may have found throughout the day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun (Optional) 🎈🎉🥳:\r\nWatched a movie called Sleep Dealer. It was pretty interesting.\r\n",

    "body": "# Thursday\r\n\r\nToday I took some time to update the [Roadmap](https://github.com/studydash/cards/issues/75) again.  As often happens when I work on my personal projects, since there is no client directly giving me requirements, it means my mind often wanders in a dozen different directions.  At a high-level, I'm obviously working on `StudyDash`-- a blogging CMS/gamification platform powered by GitHub.  But once you break it down, there are obviously many moving parts to the project.  For my own clarification, I jotted down all of the separate components of the project again.  After writing it all down, it was easier to see everything all on the same page and glean clarity on what should be prioritized and what piques my interest.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Today's Progress\r\nI decided to work on revamping the `MembersPane` today.  Reviewing all the tasks, this seemed like an easy win.  There's a `Go server` [change](https://github.com/r002/storyline-api/issues/4) I need to make and deploy first before I deploy this GUI though; will try to do that later tonight.  Here's what the revamp currently looks like though:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/125857647-74924fe1-7523-43d3-bc4b-2b13e17533c7.png)\r\n\r\nIt's much easier to see `Missed Days` at a glance now.  Also, up next: **_hovercards_**.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://github.com/r002/storyline-api/issues/4\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Fun/Extra 🎉\r\nWatched the s1e06 season finale of _Loki_ today.  Was impressed!  I'm not familiar with the comic book source material at all but the entire show seemed to be a version of the \"Pre-Crime\" police from _Minority Report_ + the anime, _Steins;Gate_ + _Rick and Morty_ (especially the last episode with [Jonathan Majors](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3718007/) as _\"He Who Remains\"_-- this is totally ripped from _Rick vs the Citadel of Ricks_! 😂).  Even if the ideas were unoriginal, I still really enjoyed watching Tom Hiddleston and [Sophia Di Martino](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1620545) (Sylvie) light up the screen.  Good stuff!  😄\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/125820790-98a62c74-6293-4e4c-ab00-bd5edbf69819.png)\r\n",

    "body": "# Wednesday\r\nAlright!  Today, I coded the first version of my `RegEx replacer` that translates the additional markdown [syntax](https://github.com/studydash/cards/issues/200) that I want to support in my `GitHub Chromium extension`. (Oh-so-cleverly, I've decided to call this `Enhanced-GitHub Flavored Markdown` (Enh-[GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/)) atm. 😄)\r\n\r\nIn order to speed up testing, I coded a separate `testbed` for the `RegEx replacer`.  So far, two gifs are supported along with YouTube embeds (in three different formats).  In the `testbed`, there's a freeform `textarea` on the LHS that you type your markdown in; and then hitting `ctrl-s` will preview that markdown in the RHS `div`.\r\n\r\nEventually, I'll serve this `testbed` as a static HTML page that anyone can play with, just to see the new features that the extension offers for enhancing GitHub issue markdown.\r\n\r\nWe're on our way!  😀🎉🥳\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/125712096-1694d275-3f3d-421c-99e4-3bdede1b96d1.png)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun 🎉\r\nIn the evening, Shaza and I went for a walk in Sharon Woods and then stopped by Uncle Yip's in Sharonville for dinner (Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup)!

They were generous enough to give me a whole project write-up. One part involves some C#. So today's motivation is learning C# to tackle the project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Today's Goal/Solution 🥅:\r\nFollow along with [Caleb Curry's C# YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_c9BZzLwBRIXCJGLd4UzqH34uCclOFwC).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Result 🍓🍌🍉:\r\nMade the classic Hello World! program. Also, read some input from the console. Learned about some of the basic structures of a C# program.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Observations & Next Steps 🔭👣:\r\nI appreciate Python even more. LOL I think I develop affinities for languages that I'm studying and shun the others. So once again, I have to give myself enough time with C# so that I don't immediately do the comparison thing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References 🔗:\r\nLink any useful resources you may have found throughout the day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun (Optional) 🎈🎉🥳:\r\nN/A\r\n",

    "body": "# Tuesday\r\nWhat a ride.  The very first card I ever contributed to this `\"GitHub as a blogging CMS\"` project (what eventually became [`StudyDash`](https://studydash.github.io/)!) was on [`Monday - May 3, 2021`](https://github.com/studydash/cards/issues/5).  72 days later, we're still going strong and have even picked up some new friends along the way!  🥳\r\n\r\nSince GitHub was never designed to be a blogging CMS, there have always been some features that were missing which are common on other blogosphere platforms (eg. `Blogger` or `WordPress`).  Once I dug into extension development more, I realized this was a golden opportunity to now support some of these features!\r\n\r\nThus, moving forward, I'm going to keep track of all of the extension features in this card.  @anitabe404 had an awesome [suggestion](https://github.com/studydash/cards/issues/198#issuecomment-878786088) to include gif support! 😀 I've still got to figure out the details, but to start with, below are the gifs and their syntax I'm going to initially support.  If anyone has any suggestions for additional gifs, please lmk your favorites! 😄\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Gifs:\r\n| Syntax | Description |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| `::gif/picard::` | ![image](https://media.tenor.com/images/cf284bb8e2b9e68ee642fc8a4801a670/tenor.gif) |\r\n| `::gif/leo::` | ![image](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CarefreeFlamboyantJackal-size_restricted.gif) |\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## YouTube embeds:\r\nI've always loved embedding YouTube video iframes directly into posts.  High time `GitHub Issues` gets the feature!  Ie. People should be able to directly play the video without ever leaving GitHub.  The `syntax` will look like this:\r\n\r\n| Syntax | Description |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| [`::https://youtu.be/CAibrKvKK58::`](https://youtu.be/CAibrKvKK58) or<br />[`::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR9F-fKEP10::`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR9F-fKEP10) or<br />[`::https://www.youtube.com/watch/fWNaR-rxAic::`](https://www.youtube.com/watch/fWNaR-rxAic) | Shows YouTube video iframe embed |\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://feathericons.com/\r\n- https://primer.style/css/utilities/colors\r\n- https://primer.style/css/support/variables\r\n- https://primer.style/primitives/\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun 🎉\r\nToday, I watched _Black Widow_ at home; it was good!  For me, personally, David Harbour totally stole the show as Red Guardian and was my favorite character in the movie. 🥳  I've loved him ever since his _The Newsroom_ and _Stranger Things_ days so this was a fun trip to watch him don the suit of a Soviet superhero! 😄\r\n\r\nPS. This [scene](https://youtu.be/91vFUx0v8pc?t=33) absolutely had me in stiches. 😂\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45280066/125753037-1f1c5874-511a-4874-b351-04c6311b8edf.png)\r\n",

A bit disappointing. I think the final assignment could've been something more meaningful. It's a geocding exercise and since that's not really my thing, I don't think I'll spend much time parsing through the assignment. Also, the database that the code generated seemed a bit unstable. It kept crashing on me when I was running queries. Anyways, I'm waiting on the peer grading to be completed so I can get my final grade and be done.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Observations & Next Steps 🔭👣:\r\nNext step: Course 5 - Capstone Project!!! Woohoo \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References 🔗:\r\nLink any useful resources you may have found throughout the day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra/Fun (Optional) 🎈🎉🥳:\r\nBlew bubbles with the kiddo. Simple times.\r\n",
